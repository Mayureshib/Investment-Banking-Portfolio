# Portfolio Analysis, Asset Allocation, and Optimization Using Monte Carlo Simulation

This project applies Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to construct an optimal investment portfolio using Python. It includes return calculations, risk measurement, Monte Carlo simulations, and optimization techniques to identify the best risk-return trade-off.

## 📊 Project Components
- Daily return computation for selected assets  
- Randomized portfolio generation  
- Monte Carlo simulation of thousands of portfolios  
- Efficient Frontier construction  
- Optimal portfolio identification (maximum Sharpe & minimum variance)  

## 🧠 Key Insights
This model shows how diversification impacts risk, how asset weights change portfolio volatility, and how optimization finds combinations that outperform manual allocation.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## 📎 Files Included
- `Portfolio_Optimization.ipynb`  
- `market_data.csv` (asset prices used)  
- `README.md`
